# Cosmology and Dark Matter

I will be adding Cosmology and Dark Matter Resources week wise here so that you can follow these through.

## Week 1: Big Bang, Higgs Boson, The Accelerating Universe
This is a Coursera course [From the Big Bang to Dark Energy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/big-bang) that you can start off with. Focus on completing Week - 1 and Week - 2 (You can audit the course easily).

This is a complete lecture on **The accelerating Universe** by Brain Schmidt and is about an hour long, so make sure to complete this - [The accelerating Universe](https://youtu.be/55pcpTjd3BY)

These are some interesting introducting Youtube videos that you can watch as well:
- [The Beginning of Everything -- The Big Bang](https://youtu.be/wNDGgL73ihY)
- [Origins of the Universe 101 | National Geographic](https://youtu.be/HdPzOWlLrbE)
- [How Do We Know The Universe Is ACCELERATING?](https://youtu.be/tXkBfkeJJ5c)
- [What is the universe expanding into? - Sajan Saini](https://youtu.be/6PiyUjVxukI)

## Week 2: Introduction to Dark Energy and Dark Matter
For an introduction to dark matter and dark energy, these are some really cool animations which you can watch.

- [What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?](https://youtu.be/QAa2O_8wBUQ)
- [Dark matter: The matter we can't see - James Gillies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HneiEA1B8ks)
- [Dark Matter: Crash Course Astronomy #41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W3RsaWuCuE)
- [The search for dark matter -- and what we've found so far | Risa Wechsler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQMLFryA_7k)

These are some pretty interesting articles on dark matter that you can read up.
