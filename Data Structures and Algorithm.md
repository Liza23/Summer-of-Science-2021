# Data Structures and Algorithm
I will be adding Data Structures and Algorithm Resources week wise here so that you can follow these through.

## Week 1: Quick Revision of C++
This is standard C++ website that you can keep in your list to refer whenever you want to check some syntax or inbuilt libraries - [CPlusPlus](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)

These are again some quick standard resources to revise C++:
- [C++ W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
- [CPP Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming)
- [C++ Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm)

Revise loops, strings, arrays and pointers from any of these resources.

## Week 2: Abstract Data Types
This is like an introductory topic to data structures, follow [this introductory article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-data-types/) on ADT. Mainly study what Lists, Stacks and Queues are. You can follow these or any other available online.

- [List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/list-cpp-stl/)
- [Queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-cpp-stl/)
- [Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-in-cpp-stl/)

## Week 3: Sorting Algorithms 
These are basic most algorithms to know when studying DSA and come handy while solving lot of problems. Start of with the basic ones like binary search, merge sort, selection sort, quick sort and insertion sort. You can look up various others as well. Study what kind of data structure is used to code these. Refer to any of these links (make a note of these website, comes handy - follow any one of these).
