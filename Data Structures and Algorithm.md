# Data Structures and Algorithm
I will be adding Data Structures and Algorithm Resources week wise here so that you can follow these through.

## Week 1: Quick Revision of C++
This is standard C++ website that you can keep in your list to refer whenever you want to check some syntax or inbuilt libraries - [CPlusPlus](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)

These are again some quick standard resources to revise C++:
- [C++ W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
- [CPP Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming)
- [C++ Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm)

Revise loops, strings, arrays and pointers from any of these resources.
