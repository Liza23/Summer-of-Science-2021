# High Energy Astronomy
I will be adding High Energy Astronomy Resources week wise here so that you can follow these through.

## Week 1: Introduction to Astronomy 
We'll start with the basic astronomy [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rHUDWjR5gg&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPAJr1ysd5yGIyiSFuh0mIL) Videos, these are short, interesting and really informative videos. 

There are 48 of these but you can try completing the first 10-15 something and feel free to go through all of them if you find these interesting. 

## Week 2: EM Radiation (Gamma Rays + X-Rays)
[This](https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html) gives a broad overview of the EM Radiation that is present. You can dig deeper with into what [Gamma Rays](https://www.livescience.com/50215-gamma-rays.html) and [X-Ray Radiation](https://www.livescience.com/32344-what-are-x-rays.html) are.

When you understand what Gamma Rays are, it is equally interesting to understand what [Gamma Ray Burst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLykC1VN7NY) is, so check the video out!

These are some additional interesting stuff if you wish to watch:

- [How X-rays see through your skin - Ge Wang](https://youtu.be/gsV7SJDDCY4)

## Week 3: Black Holes
This is far by the most interesting topic that I have enjoyed personally. There are tons of introductory videos that are avaliable out there and you can watch any of those as they have equally good animation, some of these I've linked below:

- [Black Holes Explained â€“ From Birth to Death](https://youtu.be/e-P5IFTqB98)
- [The Ultimate Guide to Black Holes](https://youtu.be/QqsLTNkzvaY)
- [Black Holes: Crash Course Astronomy #33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZWPBKULkdQ)

Further, you can read about types of black holes from [here](https://spaceandbeyondbox.com/the-different-types-of-black-holes-and-how-they-form/). You can also read from these super nice blogs:

- [Black Holes | Swin Astronomy](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/B/Black+Hole)
- [Black Holes | NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes)
