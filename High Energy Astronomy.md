# High Energy Astronomy
I will be adding High Energy Astronomy Resources week wise here so that you can follow these through.

## Week 1: Introduction to Astronomy 
We'll start with the basic astronomy [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rHUDWjR5gg&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPAJr1ysd5yGIyiSFuh0mIL) Videos, these are short, interesting and really informative videos. 

There are 48 of these but you can try completing the first 10-15 something and feel free to go through all of them if you find these interesting.
