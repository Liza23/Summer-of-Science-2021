# High Energy Astronomy
I will be adding High Energy Astronomy Resources week wise here so that you can follow these through.

## Week 1: Introduction to Astronomy 
We'll start with the basic astronomy [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rHUDWjR5gg&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPAJr1ysd5yGIyiSFuh0mIL) Videos, these are short, interesting and really informative videos. 

There are 48 of these but you can try completing the first 10-15 something and feel free to go through all of them if you find these interesting. 

## Week 2: EM Radiation (Gamma Rays + X-Rays)
[This](https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html) gives a broad overview of the EM Radiation that is present. You can dig deeper with into what [Gamma Rays](https://www.livescience.com/50215-gamma-rays.html) and [X-Ray Radiation](https://www.livescience.com/32344-what-are-x-rays.html) are.

When you understand what Gamma Rays are, it is equally interesting to understand what [Gamma Ray Burst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLykC1VN7NY) is, so check the video out!

These are some additional interesting stuff if you wish to watch:

- [How X-rays see through your skin - Ge Wang](https://youtu.be/gsV7SJDDCY4)

## Week 3: Black Holes
This is far by the most interesting topic that I have enjoyed personally. There are tons of introductory videos that are avaliable out there and you can watch any of those as they have equally good animation, some of these I've linked below:

- [Black Holes Explained – From Birth to Death](https://youtu.be/e-P5IFTqB98)
- [The Ultimate Guide to Black Holes](https://youtu.be/QqsLTNkzvaY)
- [Black Holes: Crash Course Astronomy #33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZWPBKULkdQ)

Further, you can read about types of black holes from [here](https://spaceandbeyondbox.com/the-different-types-of-black-holes-and-how-they-form/). You can also read from these super nice blogs:

- [Black Holes | Swin Astronomy](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/B/Black+Hole)
- [Black Holes | NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes)

## Week 4: Neutron Stars
A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star, which had a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses, possibly more if the star was especially metal-rich. Except for black holes, and some hypothetical objects (e.g. white holes, quark stars, and strange stars), neutron stars are the smallest and densest currently known class of stellar objects. Start with the Wiki article and then follow the articles/ videos!

- [Neutron Stars | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star)
- [Neutron Stars – The Most Extreme Things that are not Black Holes](https://youtu.be/udFxKZRyQt4)
- [Neutron Stars: Crash Course Astronomy #32](https://youtu.be/RrMvUL8HFlM)
- [Neutron Stars Introduction](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/N/Neutron+Star)

This is an interesting video on Neutron Stars which you can watch -- [What If a Spoonful of Neutron Star Appeared on Earth?](https://youtu.be/XVXrDX9zwfM)!

## Week 5: Active Galatic Nucleus
An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a compact region at the center of a galaxy that has a much-higher-than-normal luminosity over at least some portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with characteristics indicating that the luminosity is not produced by stars. Such excess non-stellar emission has been observed in the radio, microwave, infrared, optical, ultra-violet, X-ray and gamma ray wavebands. Again, start with Wiki article and follow along!

- [Active Galatic Necleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus)
- [Active Galactic Nuclei (Intro Astronomy module 13, lecture 7)](https://youtu.be/X7kzOm7dbPE)
- [What Are Active Galactic Nuclei?](https://webbtelescope.org/resource-gallery/articles/pagecontent/filter-articles/what-are-active-galactic-nuclei?filterUUID=a776e097-0c60-421c-baec-1d8ad049bfb0)

**Quasars** and **Pulsars** are a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN). So read about these as well!

- [NASA | What is a Pulsar?](https://youtu.be/gjLk_72V9Bw)
- [Pulsars and Neutron Stars](https://youtu.be/oLoLey75i2k)

## Week 6: Supernovas
A **supernova** is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion. This transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion.

## Week 7: Wrap Up!
Gravitation waves are a hot topic currently after their recent confirmation of existence and it would be good topic to look at to wrap the project. Checkout these links:
